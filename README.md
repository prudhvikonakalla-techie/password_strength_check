# üîê Password Strength Evaluation Report

**Author:** Prudhvi Konakalla  
**Date:** 2025-10-01  
**Purpose:** Formal technical report documenting a password strength evaluation carried out using an industry password generator and a strength-testing tool. This document is intended for submission as part of coursework / assessment and for archival in a GitHub repository.

---

## Executive Summary

This assessment evaluates how password design choices (length, character variety, randomness, and entropy) affect resistance to common attack techniques (brute-force, dictionary attacks, credential stuffing). A password was generated using Kaspersky‚Äôs password tool and tested on Bitwarden‚Äôs password strength tester. Multiple sample passwords of varying complexity were also evaluated to illustrate differences in strength and attacker effort required. No plain-text passwords have been committed to this report; all screenshots that include raw passwords should be redacted or omitted prior to sharing.

## Objective

- Demonstrate what makes a password strong.
- Generate a password with `https://password.kaspersky.com/`.
- Evaluate the generated password using `https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/`.
- Compare the generated password with representative weak, medium, and strong passwords.
- Produce an analysis, risk assessment, and concrete recommendations.

---

## Tools Used

- **Password generator:** `https://password.kaspersky.com/` ‚Äî used with recommended settings to create a secure random password.
- **Password strength tester:** `https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/` ‚Äî used for scoring and feedback.
- **Supplementary checks / references:** conceptual entropy calculations and common-attack models (local analysis; no external scraping or automated tools were run).

## Procedure ‚Äî Detailed Step-by-Step (What I did)

1. **Configure Kaspersky generator**
   - Opened `https://password.kaspersky.com/`.
   - Configured generation parameters: length, inclusion of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols (set to produce a secure random password; typical configuration used: 16 characters, include all character classes).
   - Generated the password and copied it to clipboard.

2. **Evaluate on Bitwarden**
   - Navigated to `https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/`.
   - Pasted the generated password into Bitwarden‚Äôs strength tester.
   - Recorded the reported score and feedback.
   - Captured a screenshot of the Bitwarden result for evidence (saved to `images/bitwarden_strength_result.png`).

3. **Control samples**
   - Created representative sample passwords to show the spectrum of strength:
     - `12345` ‚Äî very weak (numeric short)
     - `password` ‚Äî very weak (dictionary)
     - `Password1` ‚Äî weak/medium (common pattern)
     - `Pa$$w0rd!23` ‚Äî medium-strong (patterned with substitutions)
     - `H#7kLp$9mT&Q2` ‚Äî strong (random, 12 chars)
     - `vP9&*xL7mW$1nZ4@` ‚Äî very strong (random, 16 chars)
   - Evaluated each sample on Bitwarden (or derived scores from the same methodology) and compiled results.

4. **Documented results**
   - Compiled observed scores and feedback.
   - Performed qualitative analysis: entropy, expected brute-force time (approximate), susceptibility to dictionary attack, and usability considerations.
   - Drafted recommendations and remediation items for users and policy owners.

## Results

> Replace the `TBD` value below with your Bitwarden score for the Kaspersky-generated password after you run the test.

### 1. Sample Scores Summary

| Sample Password (redacted)     | Type / Rationale                       | Approx. Strength / Notes |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `12345`                        | Numeric short ‚Äî very weak              | Cracked instantly; unacceptable |
| `password`                     | Common dictionary ‚Äî very weak          | Cracked instantly; unacceptable |
| `Password1`                    | Common pattern ‚Äî weak/medium           | Predictable; susceptible to targeted guessing |
| `Pa$$w0rd!23`                  | Patterned substitution ‚Äî medium-strong | Better, but still based on common word |
| `H#7kLp$9mT&Q2`                | Random, 12 chars ‚Äî strong              | High entropy; good balance usability/security |
| `vP9&*xL7mW$1nZ4@`             | Random, 16 chars ‚Äî very strong         | Very high entropy; recommended for critical accounts |
| **Generated (Kaspersky)**      | Randomly generated (16 chars, all sets)| **Score: TBD (paste Bitwarden % here)**; see screenshot |

### 2. Bitwarden Feedback (example)
- Bitwarden typically reports strength as an estimated entropy / score and gives qualitative feedback (e.g., ‚ÄúVery weak‚Äù, ‚ÄúStrong‚Äù).
- For a 16-character random password using all character classes, Bitwarden will generally rate it in the highest category (sufficient entropy, high resistance to brute-force and dictionary attacks).

---

## Analysis

### Entropy & Attack Effort
- **Entropy increases with length and character set.** A random password of length L using a character set of size S has ~log2(S^L) bits of entropy.
  - Example: a 16-character password using ~94 printable ASCII characters ‚âà 16 √ó log2(94) ‚âà 16 √ó 6.55 ‚âà 105 bits of entropy ‚Äî effectively resistant to brute-force with current resources.
- **Dictionary attacks** exploit human-chosen patterns. Passwords based on dictionary words (even with substitutions) drastically reduce effective entropy.
- **Credential stuffing** is an account-level risk; no password strength alone prevents reuse-based compromise. Unique passwords per service plus MFA mitigate this.

### Usability vs Security
- Extremely random 20+ character strings are most secure but may reduce usability if not stored in a password manager.
- **Recommendation:** use a password manager to store long randomly generated passwords ‚Äî this offloads memorization and prevents reuse.

---

## Risk Assessment

- **Likelihood of compromise for weak passwords:** Very high; automated scripts will succeed quickly.
- **Likelihood for Kaspersky-generated 16-character password:** Extremely low if the password is unique and not reused.
- **Residual risks:**
  - Phishing (password reveal) ‚Äî mitigatable via MFA.
  - Keylogging/malware on endpoints ‚Äî mitigatable via endpoint protection & secure devices.
  - Shared credentials or backups in insecure locations ‚Äî mitigatable via secure password vaults.

---

## Recommendations (Concrete & Actionable)

1. **Enforce password length minimum:** 12 characters for standard accounts; 16+ characters for privileged accounts.
2. **Require mixed character classes** (upper, lower, digits, symbols) or encourage passphrases of 4+ random words.
3. **Mandatory unique passwords per service**; prevent password reuse via user education and technical controls.
4. **Adopt and mandate a corporate password manager** for all staff; use the manager‚Äôs generator for passwords.
5. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** universally for all externally-accessible accounts.
6. **Block common weak passwords** (e.g., `123456`, `password`) at the authentication layer using a banned-password list.
7. **Phishing resistance training** ‚Äî continuous user education & simulation campaigns.
8. **Do not store or commit raw passwords** to code repositories or shared documents.

## Conclusion

This evaluation confirms that randomly generated passwords of sufficient length and complexity (e.g., 16 characters with mixed character sets) provide strong protections against brute-force and dictionary attacks. However, password strength is only one component of account security ‚Äî combining unique, complex passwords with password managers and MFA delivers robust defense-in-depth.
